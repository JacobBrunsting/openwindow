<h2>
    Database server write areas
</h2>
<p>
    Each box represents a database server. Each database server accepts and
    stores posts only from a certain area of the world (posts are denoted with 
    black dots). This range may change
    as servers are added/removed from the network.

<h2>
    Database server read areas
</h2>
<p>
    Each box represents a database server. Each database server contains posts
    from a specific area of the world. This range must fully contain the
    server's write range, since at any point a post can be added from anywhere
    inside of that range, so we must assume that the sever is storing posts 
    from that area. Since the write range occasionally changes, the read range
    may also need to cover areas not in the write range, to account for posts
    that were added before the write range changed sizes. This range is
    recalculated periodically.

<p>
    Press one of the 'simulate error' buttons to kill the specified server 
    without notifying any of the other servers in the network. In ~15-25 
    seconds, the network will detect the server failure, and run the failover
    logic. Then you can refresh the page to see the changes that were made.
</p>
<p>
    For web server failures, all web servers in the network will be notified
    about the failure, and the load balancer will remove the server from it's
    list of valid servers.
</p>
<p>
    For database server failures, an existing database server will expand to
    service the same area of the world as the killed server, and will retrieve
    and store the posts previously stored at the killed server from their backup
    location. The expanded server will back up to the same server that the 
    killed server backed up to.
